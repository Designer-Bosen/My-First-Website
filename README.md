# My Website Designing in Progress

**Credit: Thanks ChatGPT Go for teaching me html and CSS.**

I always hope one day I can have my own website used to record my academic interets and life. My personal site works both as a inventory for me to lookup concepts and a media to present myself in an aesthetic manner. I hope I can get more on this in the future. Also this is a good practice of frontend development and UI visual design.
